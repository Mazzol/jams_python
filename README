This is the PYTHON library of the

Department Computational Hydrosystems
Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ
Permoserstr. 15
04318 Leipzig
Germany

The documentation of the library is in the docstring of ufz.py so that one can get help on the
Python prompt:
>>> import ufz
>>> help(ufz)

The individual functions also provide their help as doctrings.
Getting, for example, help on fread for reading ascii files:
>>> import ufz
>>> help(ufz.fread)

The library is maintained with a subversion system at:
https://svn.ufz.de/chs-svn/PYTHON_chs_lib/
