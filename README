The library has to be in your Python path. For example in bash:
    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/the/ufz/library
It can also be installed with the usual setup.py commands using distutils:
    python setup.py install
If one wants to use the development capabilities of setuptools, you can use something like
    python -c "import setuptools; execfile('setup.py')" develop
This basically creates an .egg-link file and updates an easy-install.pth file so that the project is on sys.path by default.
Distutils also allows to make Windows installers with
    python setup.py bdist_wininst


The documentation of the library is in the docstring of ufz.py so that one can get help on the
Python prompt:
>>> import ufz
>>> help(ufz)

The individual functions also provide their help as doctrings.
Getting, for example, help on fread for reading floats from ascii files:
>>> import ufz
>>> help(ufz.fread)


One can produce html versions of the documentation in a directory html by calling the script: ./makehtml


The library is maintained with a subversion system at:
https://svn.ufz.de/svn/chs-svn/PYTHON_chs_lib/

Further information can be found at:
https://svn.ufz.de/chs-svn/wiki/WikiPython


The above wiki will be printed to a PDF file from time to time, which is provided in wiki.pdf.
Be aware that the current PDF is not always up to date.


The Library is compatible with Python 2 and 3 (> 2.6).
Note that not all packages but one used by the library are already Python 3 ready (except pyhdf).
Reading HDF4 files is thus disabled in python 3.

Essential third-party libraries are numpy and scipy.
Reading of special files needs pyhdf, h5py and netCDF4 for HDF4, HDF5 and NetCDF files, resp.
Some functions provide visual checks using matplotlib for plotting.
mad.py uses bottleneck, if available.
mc_plot_template.py shows some matplotlib capabilities. It uses basemap and cartopy for maps, if available.
